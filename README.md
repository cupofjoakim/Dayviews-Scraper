Dayviews-Scraper
================

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS SCRAPER IS NOT IN A READY-TO-USE STATE.**

A scraper that downloads all the posts from a non-password-protected dayviews (formerly known as bilddagboken) account.

# Dependencies
There's only one major dependency for this script: [PhantomJS][http://phantomjs.org/]. Make sure to install it, otherwise nothing's going to run.

# Usage
1. You need to specify two url's in the code for now - the entry point (the first image uploaded) as well as the user profile link.
2. Run "phantomjs scrape.js" from your terminal. Make sure that you're standing in the right folder.
